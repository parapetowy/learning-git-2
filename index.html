			<p>I hear the drums echoing tonight </p>
			<p>But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation </p>
			<p>She's coming in 12:30 flight </p>
			<p>The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation </p>
			<p>I stopped an old man along the way </p>
			<p>Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies </p>
			<p>He turned to me as if to say , "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" </p>
		</div>
		<div class="zw">
			<p>It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you </p>
			<p>There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do </p>
			<p>I bless the rains down in Africa </p>
			<p>Gonna take some time to do the things we never had</p> 
		</div>
		<div class="zw">
			<p>The wild dogs cry out in the night </p>
		 	<p>As they grow restless longing for some solitary company </p>
		 	<p>I know that I must do what's right </p>
		 	<p>As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serangetti </p>
		 	<p>I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become</p>
