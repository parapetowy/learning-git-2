	<h1>Toto - Africa</h1>
	<p>I hear the drums echoing tonight </p>
	<p>But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation </p>
	<p>She's coming in 12:30 flight </p>
	<p>The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation </p>
	<p>I stopped an old man along the way </p>
	<p>Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies </p>
	<p>He turned to me as if to say , "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" </p>
	<p><p>
	<p>It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you </p>
	<p>There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do </p>
	<p>I bless the rains down in Africa </p>
	<p>Gonna take some time to do the things we never had</p>
